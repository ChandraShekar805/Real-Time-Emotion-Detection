# Real-Time-Emotion-Detection
# Introduction 
This project aims to classify emotions on a person's face into one of seven categories using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which was introduced at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). The dataset consists of 35,887 grayscale images (48x48 pixels), categorized into seven emotions:
😠 Angry | 🤢 Disgusted | 😨 Fearful | 😃 Happy | 😐 Neutral | 😢 Sad | 😲 Surprised
